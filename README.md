# Canonical Take Home Test
This repository houses my code for the Canonical Take Home Test part of the application process. The webpage produced can either be viewed (the easy way) by using the GitHub pages URL (https://tylerprehl.github.io/canonical-take-home/) or by following the steps below to serve the project locally.

### Steps to Serve the Webpage on LocalHost:8080
1) Make a clone of the repo in your designated directory
2) TBD

### Take-aways
<ul>
<li>Setting up the Vanilla Framework is not as easy as following their <a href="https://vanillaframework.io/docs/building-vanilla">Building with Vanilla instructions</a></li>
<li>Using a framework like Vanilla is pretty astounding for quick design production. Once I got Webpack, JavaScript, and SASS finally started working together properly, it was astoundingly easy to use the various pieces of the framework (such as the card pattern).
